### Task

Build a simplified version of Reddit.

#### Features
* Display the number of votes
* Functioning Upvote and Downvote controls
* Display the number of comments
* Sort the stories by number of upvotes
* The title should be a real link
* Other links do not need to be functional (share, save, hide, etc.)


Follow the same process we’ve done throughout this book: outline the components in the screenshot, decide which pieces of state you need to keep and which components should own that state, then start building components.

Reddit’s API is public and you don’t need a key. You can use static data from e.g. http://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs.json – save this to a file and import it as we’ve done in a few of the examples.
